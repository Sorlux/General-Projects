# General-Projects


This code is a Python program that creates a budgeting tool in an Excel workbook. The program creates an Excel workbook with a table and a calendar with the abbreviations of the months and days of the year as cells in the first column. The user can enter the names of their desired categories to use for budgeting. The program also adds four extra categories that will be used for data analysis. I built this when looking at recent receipts from various purchases and thought about how it is often important for students to keep track of their spending. As a result, some people would benefit from having a program that can automate all the data management in the background. It allowed me to automate actions such as calculating totals from the data the user inputs, while creating graphs automatically without the user needing to fully understand what is going on in the program.

I am still working on this project in the background and intend to continue developing features for it in my free time as I continue with my studies. Currently I have space holders for features I will add in the future and will organize each of the features' specific functions into seperate modules and create a package for all the modules.

To use the program, run the python program on any file folder and it will create the template and prompt you for what you want to do. To go back while inside an option, type "return".
