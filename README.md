# General-Projects

Hello! This will be my repository for uploading general projects I am working on in the background. I plan to fill this with experimental programs, programs to test my understanding/knowledge of a particular subject, or just code I write for fun in my free time.

Currently, the only project I have on here is an Excel template I wrote in Python that will create a template for the user to keep track of their Budgeting needs. The program uses the Openpyxl module to control an Excel workbook and automatically creates a template the user can manipulate directly from the python program. I built this when looking at recent receipts from various purchases and thought about how it is often important for students to keep track of their spending. As a result, some people would benefit from having a program that can automate all the data management in the background. It allowed me to automate actions such as calculating totals from the data the user inputs, while creating graphs automatically without the user needing to fully understand what is going on in the program. Finally, it is also a way for me to continue to practice and understand data manipulation using Python.

I am still working on this project in the background and intend to continue developing features for it in my free time as I continue with my studies.
